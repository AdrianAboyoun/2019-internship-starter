# 2019-internship-starter

## Introduction

Complete this NodeJS application so that it generates a sequence of [Fibonacci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) numbers, and correctly formats a multiplication table of these numbers. Parts of the application are already written, you should complete the tasks and make sure all tests pass.

## Tasks to complete

This application comes with a set of tests. Some tests are passing and others are failing. Your job will be to get the failing tests to pass by writing your algorithm(s) and running the tests until each of the tests is passing.

Here are the algorithms you'll need to implement:

1. Generate a sequence of Fibonacci numbers - This should be done in the file: `fibonacci.js`.
2. Format the multiplication table output to align the numbers evenly, accounting for numbers having different numbers of digits - This should be done in the file `tableFormatter.js`.
