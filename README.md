## Jobs to be done

You have a few jobs to be done to complete this program. We've added some tests that are skipped - you can identify these in the test files with the `xtest`. To make these tests run, remove the `x` and run the command `npm test` to make the tests run, and fail.

Your jobs are below, the tests are there to help you, and feel free to add more.

1. Implement an algorithm to generate a sequence of fibonacci numbers - see `fibonacci.js`
2. Implement an algorithm to properly format the table output to take account of padding - see `tableFormatter.js`
3. Optional: Implement further functions `power` and `add` within the `tableMaker.js` to give further options for table creation
